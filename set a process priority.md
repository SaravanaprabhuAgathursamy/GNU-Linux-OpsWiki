Set a process priority

The `renice` tool lets us alter the scheduling priority of a running process.

To decrease the priority of a running process:
```
renice new_priority -p PID_OF_THE_PROCESS
```
Like :
```
renice 16 -p 13245
13245: old priority 10, new priority 16
```

The same to increase it:
```
renice 5 -p 13254
13254: old priority 16, new priority 5
```
Priorities can be from -20 to 20
