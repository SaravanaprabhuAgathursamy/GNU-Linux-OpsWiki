PPAs

PPAs are for non standard software/updates. They are generally used by people who want the latest and greatest. If you are going extra lengths to get this kind of software, then you are expected to know what you are doing. 

On the command line you can add a PPA using the `add-apt-repository` utility, e.g.:
```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwibber-daily/ppa
```

If you get an error that the add-apt-repository command could not be found:

On Ubuntu 12.04 and earlier, install the python-software-properties package:
```
$ sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
```
On Ubuntu 14.04 and later:
```
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
```
You can remove a ppa by doing
```
$ sudo ppa-purge ppa:<lp-name>/<ppa-name>
```
