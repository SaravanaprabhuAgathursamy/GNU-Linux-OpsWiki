Prevent updating a specific package

There are several ways of holding back a package (thus preventing it from update).

Here is how we do it using apt/aptitude

Using apt:

you can hold a package using
```
sudo apt-mark hold package_name
```
and remove the hold with
```
sudo apt-mark unhold package_name
```

Using aptitude

you can hold a package using
```
sudo aptitude hold package_name
```
and remove the hold with
```
sudo aptitude unhold package_name
```
