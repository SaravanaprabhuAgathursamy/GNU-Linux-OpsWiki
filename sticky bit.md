Sticky Bit

The sticky bit is a permission bit that protects the files within a directory. If the directory has the sticky bit set, a file can be deleted only by the owner of the file, the owner of the directory, or by root. This special permission prevents a user from deleting other users' files from public directories such as /tmp:
```
/tmp# ll .
drwxrwxrwt 17 root    root    4096 Jul 20 01:09 ./
```
