Find any Unix / Linux command

Its an easy task to do keyword searches under linux using the `apropos` command.
Each manual page has a short description available within it and  `apropos` searches the descriptions for instances of keyword.

Find out all user related administrative commands:
```
$ apropos -s8 "*delete*"
```
Some of the output:
```
addgroup (8)         - add a user or group to the system
adduser (8)          - add a user or group to the system
```
The `-s8` here is to search only in administrative commands (usable mostly by root)

More on `apropos` man page :
```
$ man apropos
```
