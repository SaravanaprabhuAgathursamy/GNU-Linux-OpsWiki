Common issue with scripts in cron

Happens often that new users set up scripts in cron without setting the execution permission first
This will make cron to call a script thats is not executable and thus fail.

By running 
```
chmod +x /path/to/scrip 
```
the script becomes executable and should resolve the issue.
