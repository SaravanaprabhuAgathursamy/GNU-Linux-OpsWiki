Install specific version of a package on debian based OS

Often happens that we need to install a specific version of a package either for testing or other reasons. 
Before we install a specific version of a package we need it's complete version.
This will be displayed when we run:
```
apt-cache showpkg <package name>
```
This will output different versions 
To install the specific version simply run run:
```
apt-get install <package name>=<version>
```
For example:
```
apt-get install subversion-tools=1.3.2-5~bpo1
```
