Getting the link speed from the terminal

To get your internet speed from the terminal there is a tool called `speedtest-cli`
and we can set it up as below:
```
$ wget -O speedtest-cli https://raw.github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest_cli.py
```

```
$ chmod +x speedtest-cli
```
Here is an output of it working:
```
$ ./speedtest-cli
