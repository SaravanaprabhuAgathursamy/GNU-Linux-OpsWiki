Useful `bash` shortcuts 

Use `ctrl-w` to delete the last word, and `ctrl-u` to delete all the way back to the start of the line. 
Use `alt-b` and `alt-f` to move by word, `ctrl-k` to kill to the end of the line, `ctrl-l` to clear the screen. 
See 
```
man readline
```
for all the default keybindings in `bash`.
