Rapidly invoke an editor to write a long, complex, or tricky command

Next time you are using your shell, try typing `ctrl-x e` (that is holding control key press `x` and then `e`). 
The shell will take what you've written on the command line thus far and paste it into the editor specified by $EDITOR. Then you can edit at leisure using all the powerful macros and commands of vi, emacs, nano, or whatever.
