Is the internet on fire ?

Its been some time that there has been this public service available via dns
called 'istheinternetonfire.com' that provides latest short security news.

You can check it on the terminal by doing:
```
dig +short -t txt istheinternetonfire.com
```

Pro tip:
add that command to your .bashrc file to get updates anytime you log in
