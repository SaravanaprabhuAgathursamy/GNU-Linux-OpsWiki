Broadcast messages across the system

Lets say we need to broadcast a message to all the logged users on the system. 
For this we use `wall` as follows:

```
echo "pulling the project" | wall 
```

Broadcast Message from userd@host                                          
        (/dev/pts/4) at 16:40 ...
