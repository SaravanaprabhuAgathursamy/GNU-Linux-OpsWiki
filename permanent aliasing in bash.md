Permanent aliasing in bash

To create an alias permanently add the alias in the end of your `.bashrc` file and execute the file.

Start by editing the file with your favorite editor(nano,vim,pico etc):

```
nano ~/.bashrc
```

And append the alias you need:
```
alias up='sudo apt-get update'
```

Save the file and execute your bashrc file
```
$ . ~/.bashrc
```

By doing this you just reloaded your configuration.
