IPtables as a service in deb based systems

You can make iptables as a service (red hat style) in debian by doing:
```
apt-get install iptables-persistent
```
as in debian iptables are mostly scripted and not as a service (red hat style)
Then you can save your settings on the fly by doing:

```
service iptables-persistnent save 
```
