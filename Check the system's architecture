Check the system's architecture 32/64
If you're ever unsure either a system you're logged in is 32 or 64 bit the first thing you could do to find out is:
```
uname -a
```

Result for a 32-bit system :
```
Linux XXX 2.6.38-8-generic ...  i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
```
whereas a 64-bit system will show:
```
Linux XXX 2.6.38-8-generic ... x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```
The `x86_64` at the end before the GNU/Linux means that the system is running a 64 bit arch
There are many ways but this is the quickest
